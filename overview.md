# Perl Syntax Highlighting

This extension provides syntax highlighting to other common Perl files which Azure DevOps does not natively highlight.

Azure DevOps currently only highlights `.pl` Perl files. This extends on that using, to the best I can, the same Monaco/Monarch language definition as that used in `.pl` files.

## Supported Extensions

- `.pm`
- `.t`
- `.cgi`
- `.psgi`
- `.pod`
