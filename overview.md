# Perl Syntax Highlighting

This extension provides syntax highlighting to other common Perl files which Azure DevOps does not natively highlight.

Azure DevOps currently only highlights `.pl` Perl files. This extends on that using, to the best I can, the same Monaco/Monarch language definition as that used in `.pl` files.

# Differences between Monaco

There appears to be some bugs in Monaco's definition used in `.pl` files that I also aim to address.
You may notice some (but should be preferred) differences between files highlighted by this extension and native `.pl` files.

If you notice any bugs feel free to report them for fixing.
