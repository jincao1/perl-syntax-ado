# Perl Syntax Highlighting

This extension provides syntax highlighting to Perl files which Azure DevOps does not natively highlight.

Microsoft currently highlights `.pl` files. This extends on that using, presumably, the same Monaco language definition.

## Supported Extensions

- .pm
- .t
- .cgi
